# Sync Version History Diff

## Features

This plugin shows you a diff view of your sync version history to compare the revisions you made over time.

It also has a colour-blind mode.

Additionally, this plugin adds a command to access the standard version history of the Sync plugin for the currently active file, which normally is only accessible over the file menu.

## Credits

All licenses and attributions can be found in the `esbuild.mjs` file for the code (and therefore in the `main.js` release), the CSS license is in `src/styles.css`. Should any license/attribution be missing, please let me know, and I will look into it.


Special thanks to @SlRvb for adapting the CSS to Obsidian and making the colour-blind mode.
