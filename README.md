# Sync Version History Command

This adds a command to access the version history of the Sync plugin for the currently active file.

In Obsidian, it is only accessible over the file menu. This plugin improves keyboard accessibility.


## Credits

All licenses and attributions can be found in the `esbuild.mjs` file for the code (and therefore in the `main.js` release), the CSS license is in `src/styles.css`. Should any license/attribution be missing, please let me know, and I will look into it.
